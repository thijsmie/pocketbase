## About

PocketBase is an amazing tool to have in your developers backpack for a quick backend for your project. I found it pleasant to work with in Python but Vaphes existing Python SDK is in sync code while most of my application development is async these days. I started with a fork of Vaphes' SDK and tried to add async support but I gave up quite quickly and just started from scratch. You see the results here.

## Installation

Note that this package is compatible with Python 3.11 and up. You can install this package directly from PyPi:
```bash
pip install pocketbase-async
# or if you use poetry
poetry add pocketbase-async
```

## Usage

The API is mostly the same as the official JS SDK and the Vaphes Python SDK, with some exceptions. Authentication methods are namespaced under an extra `.auth`. There are some examples to help you along. More info to come.

- [View the examples](https://github.com/thijsmie/pocketbase-async/tree/main/examples)

## Roadmap

See the [project board](https://github.com/thijsmie/pocketbase-async/projects?query=is%3Aopen) for the list of planned work. See the [open issues](https://github.com/thijsmie/pocketbase-async/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated, be it typo-fix, feature or extensive rework. I recommend you to open an issue if you plan to spend significant effort on making a pull request, to avoid dual work or getting your work rejected if it really doesn't fit this project.

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/some-nice-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the pranch (`git push -u origin feat/some-nice-feature`)
5. Open a pull request

## Attributions

The `pocketbase-async` package was inspired and guided in implementation by several other projects:

- The official js sdk: https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk
- The Python SDK by Vaphes: https://github.com/vaphes/pocketbase
- The official documentation: https://pocketbase.io/docs/

Furthermore, a lot of the API tests were adapted from Vaphes' work (licensed MIT).
