# Contributing to pocketbase-async

First off, thank you for considering contributing to pocketbase-async! ❤️

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. This is a small project, so just get in touch via discussions, issues, twitter, email or even linkedin before embarking on a major rewrite :wink:.

## Code of Conduct

We work under the unmodified Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thijsmie/pocketbase-async/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is my personal hope to never need it.

## I Want To Contribute

There are many ways to do this! Here is a list of the main ways you can go about this:

### Reporting Bugs

Be sure to check the existing issues on the project and make sure you are not on an old version. When that is taken care of you can write a new issue. Be sure to include the steps to reproduce the bug and some information about your environment. This is also included in the issue template for bugs.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you think your bug might be a security vurnerability _do not_ create an issue here on the public repository but make a responsible disclosure as outlined in the [Security Guidelines](https://github.com/thijsmie/pocketbase-async/tree/main/SECURITY.md)

### Feature Requests

Be sure to check if the latest release doesn't already include your feature or that it has been requested before (also check the closed issues). You can first start a discussion instead of opening an issue, this generally has a lower barrier to entry. Try to outline your feature as clearly as possible, include some code samples of how it would work.

### Contributing Code

Contributing code is very much appreciated, but make sure that your contribution doesn't come out of the blue! You should be contributing code if:

 - There is an existing bug report and you've commented you'll fix it.
 - There is an existing feature request and you've commented you want to build it.
 - There is a small enhancement: a simple obvious bugfix, a couple typos or a new example or test.

Please make sure that anything you contribute is formatted, linted and tested. You can use the steps as outlined in the `check` github actions workflow to make sure your contribution is conforming.

### Improving The Documentation

These are most welcome of all, big or small.
