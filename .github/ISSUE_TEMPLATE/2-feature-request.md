<!-- 

Before you get started, read this first!

 -> Have you made sure you are running on the latest version?

# The Why
<!-- 
All features have a reason for needing to exist. What is the thing you are trying to do?
Is that thing currently impossible or just very unwieldy, slow or unnecessarily complex?
-->

# The How
<!--
How do you imagine the solution? Ideally include some code samples of how you think it should
work from a user perspective.
-->

# The How Not
<!--
Take some time to consider some alternatives. Are there any other solutions with caveats that 
made you choose your solution?
-->

# But There Is More
<!--
Is there additional context? Are you in some hurry for a certain reason? Are you willing to
contribute the solution via PR yourself?
-->
